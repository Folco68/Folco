  Try by redefining QSpinBox::event(QEvent*) or QAbstractSpinBox::mousePress/ReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent*) instead of the QAbstractSpinBox event => new fail
  Try to inherit the QAbstractSpinBox' QLineEdit and replace it in the QSpinBox, redefine the QKeySequence::Paste and the click (focus) events
  Try to implement a class starting from a raw QLineEdit...
o IPlineEdit::mouseReleaseEvent: try to select only the clicked byte
