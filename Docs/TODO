+ set an application Icon
+ set GPL headers in src
+ DlgEditInterface: validate IP
+ Remember disconnected devices and allow to edit/forget them (usefull for USB-Eth adapters)
+ offer to give a name to preconfigured IPs. This name could be used in the menu
o offer to configure the display of the IP in the tray menu: custom name/IP, IP/custom name, ...
+ allow to set an interface to DHCP
+ look at iterators for QList browsing
o DlgPredefinedIP: merge newPredefinedIP() and editPredefinedIP()
+ IPv4 display does not work in DlgInterface
+ standardize symbols case
+ add a log, accessible through the context menu (help/about dialog)
+ backup the data file before saving
+ add help and about with "BeforeRelease" data
+ handle stream errors while saving data file
+ delete InterfaceList/Interface/PredefinedIP
+ IP validation: use QSpinBox?
+ BUG context menu opens at the center of the screen if an error message pops at first show
+ code for setting netmask and gateway is disabled
+ DlgInterface: double click a PredefinedIP should edit it
+ BUG IPspinBox::focusInEvent() redefinition does not trigger the selectAll() method because it monitors only kbd events.
  Try by redefining QSpinBox::event(QEvent*) or QAbstractSpinBox::mousePress/ReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent*) instead of the QAbstractSpinBox event => new fail
  Try to inherit the QAbstractSpinBox' QLineEdit and replace it in the QSpinBox, redefine the QKeySequence::Paste and the click (focus) events
  Try to implement a class starting from a raw QLineEdit...
o IPlineEdit::mouseReleaseEvent: try to select only the clicked byte
+ implement up/down in DlgInterface
+ accept pasting of IP address in DlgPredefinedIP
+ make About and Settings windows unique (with a static address containing the address of the widget)
+ offer to delete an Interface
o add Installations instructions in the About->Help dialog
+ remove static vars in Dlg class, see DlgHelp
+ moving up and down IP in DlgInterface does not select the right item after move
+ use W11 L&F
+ add a name to Interface, to identify them easierly, especially when disconnected
+ no more icon in the top left corner of the windows
+ remove show()/setVisible()/activateWindows() in Dlg*::showDlg() methods (thanks to class Dialog)
o one technical dialog for Settings/Merge/Log
+ data v1 makes that an Interafce is user-customized only if it has at least 1 pre-defined IP. With v2, it should support 0 PDI and a custom name
  -> revamp the way the menu are generated when popping up?
  -> two lists: HW interfaces enumerated by the system, and the InterfaceList
    -> create an empty list of Pairs: pick an HW address, and try to find a corresponding Interface
    -> remaining HW address are added and can be configured
    -> remaining Interfaces are Disconnected Interfaces
+ DlgPredefinedIP: inconsistency in window title setting (new/edit)
+ PredefinedIP embed the human readable name of their Interface, to display it when it's disconnected. Upate it from time to time
+ revamp dialogs (DlgPredefinedIP: OK, DlgConfiguration: OK)
+ offer to merge connections, usefull when migrating a PC or changing an adapter
+ replace all "manual" search of Configuration with ConfigurationList::configuration() and ConfigurationList::hasPredefinedIP()
+ comment code
+ review code for Interface/Configuration confusion (for example, see DlgConfiguration::forgetConfiguration)
+ make a real ReadMe, with pictures
o use a QTextBrowser to have clickable links for the Readme
+ prevent from merging a Configuration to an Interface which already holds that configuration
