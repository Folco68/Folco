2024/09/08
- Changed the name of the data files and the names of the class
- Revamped the DlgConfig UI, dropped the QTableWidget for the interfaces: too many useless informations. Replaced by a QComboBox

2024/09/09
- UI: changed once again the design
- Global settings (implemented with QSetting) will be used to show/hide some interfaces
- Predefined IP will be set interface per interface, from the tray icon menu

- Made InterfaceList::hasConfiguration() more accurate: now answer yes if there is at least one predefined IP
- Drafted the interface edition dialog
- Added the Settings edition dialog
- Dynamically display the interface in the context menu, according to the application settings

2024/09/16
- Partially implemented the DlgEditInterface dialog
- Implemented the DlgEditPredefinedIP dialog (validation is still rough, to be completed)

2024/09/17
- Changed the default value for the Setting key DEFAULT_SHOW_ONLY_ETHERNET_WIFI to true, to remove Loopback interface by default
- TrayIcon: fixed the submenu showing only the first Predefined IP

2024/09/21
- performed tests with netsh, skelton of calls written
- renamed the Dialog files and classes by removing the "Edit" word
- removed useless methods of PredefinedIP class

2024/09/21
- finally found how to call netsh to set an ipv4 interface to DHCP
- updated the call to set the IP by replacing hw address with interface name because:
1. netsh needs a name
2. if I use another backend to replace netsh, there is a static method to recover easily the QNetworkInterface starting from the name

2024/10/04
- added data opening and saving
- revamped DlgPredefinedIP UI by using QSpinBox instead of QLineEdit + InputMask
- added netsh call, first test show that it looks to work

2024/10/04
- set the buddy IPspinBox in DlgPredefinedIP
- allow the dot char to navigate between IP bytes
- wrote IPspinBox which inherits QSpinBox to extend some functionnalities

2024/10/05
- properly delete InterfaceList/Interface/PredefinedIP
- DlgInterface: edit a PredefinedIP by doubleclicking it
- always show the context menu close to the tray icon, even in case of file opening error

2024/10/07
- try to select the content of a IPspinBox when activated by a mouse event
- delete all the IPv4 of an interface when setting one to DHCP
- DlgInterface: display the last IPv4 address available

2024/10/12
- DlgInterface: added moveUp/moveDown() methods
- added AddTop/AddBottom boolean in tableSelectionChanged()

2024/10/12
- added datafile backup

2024/10/13
- secure DlgPredefinedIP(QWidget* parent) with default args set at nullptr to avoid random pointer dereferencing
- display a message in case of failure of saving InterfaceList file

2024/10/13
- started to implement drag&drop + pasting IP functionnality
- still fail at using netsh as a backend...

2024/11/02
- Don't use anymore QSpinBox to enter IP (it's a mess to intercept events)
- Instead use a QLineEdit + custom validator based on QValidator

2024/11/03
